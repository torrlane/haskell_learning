* Haskell learning
** TODO virtualbox view local folders
** TODO Document how to do it  (create doc folder in project)

** TODO create new job to store share data in file
*** data should come from Google spreadsheets (see finance functions)
*** think about unit testing

** TODO Change name of existing jobs to something better
*** ParseCsvMain -> PrintPerformanceStats [[file:app/ParseCsvMain.hs][ParseCsvMain]]

** TODO create a job to extract dividend data from hl website
*** for example:[[https://www.hl.co.uk/shares/shares-search-results/l/lloyds-banking-group-plc-ordinary-10p/dividends][ Lloyds Dividend information]] 
*** Get content from website and write code to parse it and extract out relevant data.


* Type ideas

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  data Dividend = Dividend
    { date     :: Day
    , currency :: String
    , amount   :: Double
    }

  -- Both instances of "Security", but extract that class out later
  data Stock = Stock {name :: String}
  data Fund = Fund {name :: String}

  -- start off with separate functions and then see if there is any commonality
  stockDividends :: Stock -> [Dividend]
  fundDividends :: Fund -> [Dividend]
