* Haskell learning
** TODO virtualbox view local folders

** TODO create new job to store share data in file
*** data should come from Google spreadsheets (see finance functions)
*** think about unit testing

** TODO Change name of existing jobs to something better
*** ParseCsvMain -> PrintPerformanceStats


** TODO create a job to extract dividend data from hl website
*** for example: https://www.hl.co.uk/shares/shares-search-results/l/lloyds-banking-group-plc-ordinary-10p/dividends
*** Get content from website and write code to parse it and extract out relevant data.


* Type ideas
** Dividend
*** Date
*** number held
*** amount per unit
*** currency

** Stock
*** name
*** sedol/ric/whatever

** function :: Stock -> IO [Dividend]
** function :: Fund -> IO [Dividend]
